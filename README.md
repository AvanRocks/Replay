# Replay

Saves a short audio replay of the last few seconds, similar to an instant replay used in sports matches. Useful during virtual school lessons. 

Negates the need to constantly record your virtual school lessons to capture a key phrase. Simply type 's' whenever you missed something and the last 30 seconds of audio will be saved to your drive.

## Options

```
-d [delay_in_sec]
```

- set the number of seconds of past audio to record when 's' is typed
- default value: 30

```
-b [bitrate_in_kHz]
```

- set the bitrate of the audio recorded
- higher bitrate means better quality audio but also a larger filesize
- default value: 50
